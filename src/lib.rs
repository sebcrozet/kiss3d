# kiss3d

Keep It Simple, Stupid 3d graphics engine.

This library is born from the frustration in front of the fact that today’s 3D
graphics library are:

* either too low level: you have to write your own shaders and opening a
  window steals you 8 hours, 300 lines of code and 10L of coffee.
* or high level but too hard to understand/use: those are libraries made to
  write beautiful animations or games. They have a lot of feature; too much
  feature if you only want to draw a few geometries on the screen.

**kiss3d** is not designed to be feature-complete or fast.
It is designed to be able to draw simple geometric figures and play with them
with one-liners.

An on-line version of this documentation is available [here](http://www.rust-ci.org/sebcrozet/kiss3d/doc/kiss3d/index.html).

## Features
Most features are one-liners.

* open a window with a default arc-ball camera and a point light.
* a first-person camera is available too and user-defined cameras are possible.
* display boxes, spheres, cones, cylinders, quads and lines.
* change an object color or texture.
* change an object transform (we use the [nalgebra](https://github.com/sebcrozet/nalgebra) library
  to do that).  An object cannot be scaled though.
* create basic post-processing effects.

As an example, having a red, rotating cube with the light attached to the camera is as simple as:

```rust
extern crate kiss3d;
extern crate nalgebra;

use nalgebra::na::{Vec3, Rotation};
use kiss3d::window::Window;
use kiss3d::light;

fn main() {
    Window::spawn("Kiss3d: cube", proc(window) {
        let mut c = window.add_cube(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);

        c.set_color(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);

        window.set_light(light::StickToCamera);

        window.render_loop(|_| {
            c.prepend_rotation(&Vec3::new(0.0f32, 0.014, 0.0))
        })
    })
}
```

Some controls are handled by default by the engine (they can be overridden by the user):

* `scroll`: zoom in / zoom out.
* `left click + drag`: look around.
* `right click + drag`: translate the view point.
* `enter`: look at the origin (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).

## Compilation
You will need the last rust compiler from the `master` branch.
If you encounter problems, make sure you have the last compiler version before creating an issue.

The simplest way to build **kiss3d** and all its dependencies is to do a
recursive clone:


    git clone --recursive git://github.com/sebcrozet/kiss3d.git
    cd kiss3d
    make deps
    make
    make examples


The last command will compile examples on the `bin` folder.
Use `make doc` to compile the documentation on the `doc` folder.

## Contributions
I’d love to see people improving this library for their own needs. However, keep in mind that
**kiss3d** is KISS. One-liner features (from the user point of view) are preferred.
